	<li><strong><em>Yapiee transforms influencer marketing in the UAE, fostering impactful collaborations between brands and influencers. </em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Yapiee App, an influencer marketing platform, has been innovative, mainly in the space of the influencer marketing apps. It changes how brands would get in touch with influencers across the UAE. Being different from others, this platform provides a path for companies of all sorts to team up with an influencer to reduce the influence marketing process while at the same time making it easier to promote businesses, allowing companies to gain visibility along with interacting with customers via meaningful engagement.</p>

<p>At the core is the AI-powered matching system which links a brand with its influencer based on their audience&#39;s demographics and interest. It means marketing campaigns would not only be effective but customized: because the needs of each business will be different. Businesses can create a unique offer to a niche audience, and that results in increased customer loyalty and sales. Importantly, Yapiee also provides an opportunity to offer the brand&#39;s goods or services in exchange for influencer collaborations instead of money, and this seems to be very cost-efficient and beneficial to both parties.</p>

<p>One of the most significant value propositions that has been there for Yapiee is its real-time collaboration functions. These help influencers as well as brands coordinate with each other in a seamless manner without causing any issues, so that the campaigns reach the right time frame and maximize the effectiveness of every marketing campaign. Thus, it&#39;s a tool crucial for any business looking to drive success in the competitive digital market.</p>

<p>Achievement in cost-effective marketing can be realized through the acquisition of this app by businesses anywhere in the UAE. This initiative not only contributes to the development of the local economy but also enhances brand engagement through influencer marketing. The app offers multilingual support in six languages: Arabic, English, German, Spanish, French, and Italian. This feature ensures that people from diverse backgrounds can connect easily, facilitating effective communication between brands and consumers, regardless of cultural and linguistic differences.</p>

<p>With flexible social media integration, Yapiee is able to connect businesses to their target audience across all the major platforms like Instagram, X, YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook. And that goes with the scope of engagement and visibility, the requirements to thrive in this competitive market today.</p>

<p>Very recently, Yapiee exhibited at GITEX/North Star 2024 held in Dubai. It marked a difference among the many 6,500 participants with regard to showcasing its unique value proposition in front of international spectators. This platform helped grab the attention of visitors and clients, as well as influencers, toward the new product.</p>

<p>It&#39;s free to download and use, and thus the application is even more attractive for brands and their influencers. Yapiee is also planning to expand its operations internationally by early 2025.</p>

<p>Summed up in a nutshell, it can be said that Yapiee is not merely a marketing tool but is something that can change the face of business entities within the UAE. It helps in bringing people closer to forming a community and increasing visibility; they are engaging the audience to a great extent by bringing forward these innovative features and continuous collaborations.</p>

						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<p>H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the UAE, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Dubai Future Foundation (DFF), today launched the Middle East&rsquo;s first-of-its-kind drone delivery system at Dubai Silicon Oasis (DSO), the special economic zone for knowledge and innovation and a member of the Dubai Integrated Economic Zones Authority (DIEZ).</p>

<p>The launch event was attended by H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, President of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority, Chairman of Dubai Airports, Chairman and Chief Executive of Emirates Airline and Group, and Chairman of the Dubai Integrated Economic Zones Authority.</p>

<p>He placed the first order using the drone delivery system through the platform from the Rochester Institute of Technology-Dubai (RIT-Dubai), one of the landing points within DSO&rsquo;s drone delivery network. The order was successfully delivered from one of the take-off points in the community.</p>

<p>H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed reaffirmed Dubai&rsquo;s commitment to developing advanced infrastructure and fostering an innovative environment to enhance smart logistics and cutting-edge air transport solutions, aligned with the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, to establish Dubai as a leader among future-ready cities.</p>

<p>His Highness said, &ldquo;We continue to support projects that drive a diversified, flexible digital economy by leveraging advanced technology in Dubai and empowering the aviation and air transport sectors. Our strategy places a high priority on strengthening public-private partnerships to catalyse research and development (R&amp;D), sustainable growth, and smart mobility. This aligns with the Dubai Economic Agenda D33, which aims to position Dubai among the world&rsquo;s top three urban economies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Highlighting the importance of economic growth driven by R&amp;D and innovation, H.H. Sheikh Hamdan said, &ldquo;Over the past years, we have launched a series of programmes in Dubai aimed at promoting the development of smart city solutions, enhancing economic integration between various sectors, and employing technology in the service of society, such as the Dubai Programme to Enable Drone Transportation, the Dubai Robotics and Automation Programme, the Dubai Research and Development Program, and Dubai&rsquo;s annual plan to accelerate the adoption of artificial intelligence. Today, we are reaping the impressive results of these initiatives and continuing the transformational projects that will double the size of Dubai&rsquo;s economy by 2033.&rdquo;</p>

<p>H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed further said, &ldquo;The future of robotic technologies and self-driving systems for retail services, and knowledge-based economic applications, innovation, digital transformation and the use of artificial intelligence have all become a reality in Dubai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His Highness emphasised Dubai&rsquo;s pioneering role in driving innovation and creating new opportunities. &ldquo;Dubai has consistently led the way in advancing research, innovation, and the adoption of transformative technologies. A decade ago, we introduced the UAE Drones for Good Award to encourage the positive use of drone technology. Today, we have reached a significant milestone with operational readiness to commence drone delivery operations. Through strong collaboration between the public and private sectors, we aim to further raise the quality of services, enhance quality of life, and accelerate economic growth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The launch was also attended by Omar bin Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State For Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications; Mattar Al Tayer, Director General and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of Dubai&rsquo;s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA); Lieutenant General Talal Belhoul Al Falasi, President of Dubai&rsquo;s State Security Department; and several senior officials.</p>

<p>His Highness&rsquo; comments were made during the completion of a joint project between Dubai Civil Aviation Authority, the Dubai Integrated Economic Zones Authority (DIEZ), and the Dubai Future Foundation (DFF), to finalise preparations for launching drone delivery services in DSO. Their efforts resulted in the creation of dedicated air routes aligned with existing airspace usage in DSO.</p>

<p>H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum emphasised that Dubai&rsquo;s global leadership in aviation, logistics, and future mobility stems from the visionary leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. This vision has established Dubai as one of the most advanced hubs for air transport and aviation solutions. Dubai also leads in excellence in research, development, and testing of cutting-edge technologies, including drones and related services, leveraging these innovations to drive development and serve communities worldwide.</p>

<p>The pilots at Dubai Silicon Oasis were the culmination of the Dubai Programme to Enable Drone Transportation, launched by H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in 2021. The MoU to initiate the programme&rsquo;s operations was signed by several government and private sector entities, including Dubai Silicon Oasis, Dubai Future Foundation, Dubai Civil Aviation Authority, the Roads and Transport Authority, Fakeeh University Hospital, Majid Al Futtaim, and Emirates SkyCargo.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, Dubai Silicon Oasis hosted a series of pilot operations for drone delivery operations to ensure the highest aviation safety and security standards. This was done in cooperation with the DCAA and Keeta Drone, a pioneer in this field and the most well-known drone delivery platform in China. This is the company&rsquo;s first venture outside the Greater China region.</p>

<p>Dr. Mohammed Al Zarooni, Executive Chairman of DIEZ, said, &ldquo;DIEZ is committed to supporting initiatives that utilise advanced technologies to facilitate people&rsquo;s daily lives, and provide a conducive environment to pilot smart solutions ahead of implementation. We are proud to be a key partner of the Dubai Program to Enable Drone Transportation, launched by H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, in 2021.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added, &ldquo;We are delighted to launch drone delivery operations at DSO, which has become an internationally recognised lab for the latest smart technologies. The launch marks a new milestone in the shift towards a future of technological innovation. We are committed to working with both, the private and public sectors, to test and implement projects and initiatives in the smart mobility field, in a bid to offer the emirate&rsquo;s residents the most advanced smart services as part of the emirate&rsquo;s broader strategy to make Dubai the world&rsquo;s best place to live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mohammed Abdullah Linjawi, Director General of DCAA, said, &ldquo;We are committed to making a vital contribution to enhancing Dubai&rsquo;s position as one of the cities best prepared for the future and a global hub for innovation in the aviation sector. This new achievement in the field of drone delivery reflects the continuous efforts made by the emirate under the guidance of the wise leadership, which has always attached great importance to developing safe and efficient transportation solutions that contribute to improving quality of life, strengthening Dubai&rsquo;s future economy and making it a leading model in developing and implementing smart solutions in the field of aviation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added, &ldquo;Drone delivery will reach 33% of Dubai by 2030, positioning the emirate as a pioneer in smart mobility. We will continue our pioneering role in creating new opportunities by regulating and operating drones and paving the way for the introduction of various emerging and promising technologies in the field of aviation in cooperation with government and private entities, and applying the best international practices to ensure the safety of air operations and using the latest technologies to enhance the efficiency of advanced logistics services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Khalfan Belhoul, CEO of Dubai Future Foundation, stressed that this achievement embodies the forward-thinking vision of the leadership and Dubai&rsquo;s commitment to design and execute the future. It also reflects Dubai&rsquo;s remarkable successes in developing advanced infrastructure and creating integrated systems to support the growth of smart mobility, delivery, and logistics services over the past years.</p>

<p>Belhoul noted, &ldquo;The Dubai Future Foundation is committed to collaborating with public and private entities, in line with H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed&rsquo;s directives to accelerate progress in vital economic and future sectors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will continue to work with our partners through various projects, programmes, and initiatives, such as the &#39;Dubai Program to Enable Drone Transportation,&#39; the &#39;Dubai Robotics and Automation Program,&#39; and the &#39;Dubai Research, Development, and Innovation Programme&#39;. This aligns with our mission to reinforce Dubai&rsquo;s position as one of the world&rsquo;s most future-ready cities,&rdquo; Belhoul added.</p>

<p>Dr. Yinian Mao, VP of Meituan and President of Keeta Drone, the overseas arm of the drone delivery unit of Meituan, a leading tech-driven retail company in China, said, &ldquo;Our venture in the Middle East aligns with the parent company&rsquo;s growth strategy. We are excited to have an ideal partner such as Dubai Integrated Economic Zones Authority that offers businesses and investors three economic zones of choice to ensure the right platform to establish and grow in this region. Through our presence in Dubai Silicon Oasis, we are keen to bring drone delivery solutions to its community and look forward to expanding the initiative across Dubai, and the wider region.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Yousef Al-Assaf, President of Rochester Institute of Technology in Dubai, said, &ldquo;We are proud to forge a unique partnership with diverse public and private sector entities in the project to test, implement and launch the first drone delivery system in the Middle East, from Dubai Silicon Oasis, which consolidates its position as a hub for future technologies. The participation of RIT-Dubai, headquartered in DSO, in this pioneering project enables it to develop its academic competencies, empower local talent, and provide a world-class academic and research laboratory environment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the aid of cutting-edge flight control algorithms and multi-sensor fusion positioning technology, the drone is designed to operate in various city landscapes. It is equipped with low-noise propellers, a parachute, and a flight control system, all developed in-house.</p>]]></description>

						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>From sophisticated design and engineering to innovative AI experiences, the HONOR X9c breaks new ground for mid-tier smartphones</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>HONOR&rsquo;s latest flagship, <strong><a href="https://www.honor.com/ae-en/phones/honor-x9c/buy/?utm_source=PRLEN&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=honorx24c&amp;utm_content=PRL">the HONOR X9c</a></strong>, is a pinnacle of innovation that redefines smartphone durability in incredible new ways. Designed with performance and survivability in mind, the HONOR X9c delivers a smartphone experience like no other, serving as a testament to the pioneering features that define HONOR&rsquo;s Series X smartphones. With impressive new durability features, the HONOR X9c is ready to accompany you wherever life takes you, and delivers outstanding performance and battery life to ensure that you&rsquo;re always connected to the world around you and beyond.</p>

<p>The HONOR X9c speaks volumes of HONOR&rsquo;s commitment to innovation in the mid-range smartphone segment by introducing features that would normally be found on high-end, flagship models. In doing this, the HONOR X9c positions itself as a truly reliable and versatile smartphone that delivers exceptional performance even in the most challenging conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Built To Overcome Life&rsquo;s Challenges</strong></p>

<p>Durability is key for the HONOR X9c, and its precision engineering and innovative safety features make it an ideal smartphone for users who want complete peace of mind with their smartphones. An example is HONOR&rsquo;s Anti-Drop Display, which is engineered to withstand drops from heights up to 2 meters. It also offers 60% greater glass impact resistance and a 52% increase in corner impact resilience over previous models, ensuring that any accidental drops never jeopardize the integrity of the smartphone.</p>

<p>The HONOR X9c is also engineered to withstand extreme conditions that would otherwise be problematic for regular smartphones. From intense temperatures to hazards such as dust and water, most smartphones would stop functioning properly or begin to experience performance issues. However, since the HONOR X9c is equipped with IP65M water and dust resistance and a three-layer waterproof structure, neither accidental water exposure nor environmental elements can compromise this smartphone. In fact, the HONOR X9c can be submerged in up to 25cm of water for a short period without compromising its performance, and can even handle extreme temperatures ranging from 30C to -55C.</p>

<p>It&#39;s common to think that a durable smartphone requires a rugged or bulky design to be effective, but the HONOR X9c dispels that myth with its sleek and attractive design. Weighing just 189g and measuring 7.98mm in thickness, the HONOR X9c is ultra-slim, making it easy to carry and comfortable to hold. It fits easily into pockets or bags without being cumbersome, and the sleek titanium finish gives it a premium look and feel.</p>

<p><strong>Battery Life That Never Lets You Down</strong></p>

<p>One of the most crucial features of any smartphone is its battery life, and here too the HONOR X9c sets a new standard in its segment. Equipped with the industry&rsquo;s first 6600mAh Silicon-carbon battery, the HONOR X9c can provide up to 3 days of usage on a single charge and is a game-changer for users who use their smartphones throughout the day. Whether it&rsquo;s streaming content, gaming, or staying connected longer, the HONOR X9c is able to provide unmatched battery life without having to reach for a charger. When it does come time for a recharge, the 66W wired HONOR SuperCharge can quickly bring the phone battery up to a full charge, and also supports an ultra-fast charging mode for quicker recharging.</p>

<p><strong>An Unmatched User Experience With MagicOS 8.0</strong></p>

<p>Beyond its remarkable design and durability, the HONOR X9c offers an intuitive user experience, thanks to AI-powered MagicOS 8.0. A variety of unique features work together to streamline everyday tasks, allowing users to focus on what matters most. For example, Magic Portal can understand the context of what is on a user&rsquo;s screen and offer helpful suggestions and shortcuts. By simply dragging content onto Magic Portal, users can get directions or product recommendations without having to go through multiple manual steps.</p>

<p>When it comes to photography, the HONOR X9c&rsquo;s world-class hardware is further enhanced by AI features, capturing timeless moments that redefine smartphone photography. The powerful, 108MP Ultra-sensing Camera is capable of capturing vivid and well-exposed images under any lighting conditions, even in challenging low-light environments. To further capture remarkable photos, the HONOR X9c is equipped with AI Motion Sensing to identify diverse scenarios using an AI network trained on a database of over 8 million images. It can then automatically detect movement in a scene and adjust camera settings automatically to capture blur-free and crisp images every time.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the AI Eraser feature allows users to quickly edit their photos to remove any unwanted elements from their photos. With a single click, users can remove people, objects, or other distractions from the background to create a professional-looking image in seconds. This is especially useful for travellers wanting to capture stunning vistas as cleanly as possible. Whether you&rsquo;re a professional at smartphone photography or a novice, the camera and AI tools on the HONOR X9c make it extremely easy to make every photograph a stunning masterpiece.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptional Visuals On A Stunning Display</strong></p>

<p>The HONOR X9c is designed to offer an elevated viewing experience, starting with its vivid 6.78-inch Eye-comfort OLED Display. With an industry-leading peak HDR brightness of 4000nits, the HONOR X9c can be viewed comfortably even in bright sunlight, offering outstanding visibility. Supporting 1.07 billion colors and a 1.5K resolution, images and content look bright and crisp, providing an immersive viewing experience for gaming, watching videos, and much more.</p>

<p>To ensure that eye fatigue is minimized, the HONOR X9c&rsquo;s display provides a high refresh rate of 120Hz, ensuring smooth motion and enhanced responsiveness throughout the interface. The 3840Hz Risk-free PWM Dimming also helps to minimize screen flickering, further reducing eye strain during extended periods of use. Lastly, the Circadian Night Display automatically adjusts the display to a warmer tone to decrease blue light emission and enhance sleep quality. In conjunction with Dynamic Dimming technology to promote effective ciliary muscle engagement, the HONOR X9c puts user safety and comfort above all, ensuring a comfortable viewing experience throughout the day.</p>

<p>The HONOR X9c confirms HONOR&rsquo;s commitment to crafting innovative and stylish products that continue to add value to users&rsquo; lives. With a host of intelligent AI features and a durable yet lightweight design, the HONOR X9c challenges all the norms of a mid-range smartphone, and offers exceptional features that effortlessly balances functionality with style. For users who need a smartphone that can keep up with their rigorous lifestyles and demanding routines, the HONOR X9c is an easy investment to make, and will no doubt be the benchmark for other smartphones to aspire to.</p>

<p>The HONOR X9c is available in four captivating colors - Titanium Purple, Titanium Black, Sunrise Orange, and Jade Cyan <a href="https://www.honor.com/ae-en/phones/honor-x9c/buy/?utm_source=PRLEN&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=honorx24c&amp;utm_content=PRL">at a price of AED 1299.

						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Cryptocurrencies rally on de-regulation expectations</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Bitcoin hits record high over $81,000</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Ether, dogecoin surge</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>soared to a record high above $81,000 on Monday on expectations that cryptocurrencies will boom in a favourable regulatory environment following the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president and pro-crypto candidates to Congress.</p>

<p>The world&#39;s biggest and best-known cryptocurrency , has now more than doubled from the year&#39;s low of $38,505 and was last at $81,572 having earlier touched a record high of $81,899.</p>

<p>Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the &quot;crypto capital of the planet&quot; and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.</p>

<p>Other so-called &#39;Trump trades&#39; - from U.S. stocks to shorting bonds have lost some steam since the election, but cryptocurrencies haven&#39;t paused for breath.</p>

<p>&quot;Bitcoin&#39;s Trump-pump is alive and well... with Republicans on the cusp of taking the house to confirm a red wave in Congress, it seems the crypto crowd are betting on digital-currency deregulation,&quot; said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index, referring to Republican control of both houses.</p>

<p>While Simpson warned Trump&#39;s near-term priorities are likely to lie elsewhere, crypto investors see an end to stepped-up scrutiny under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler whom Trump has said he will fire.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency industry spent more than $119 million backing pro-crypto congressional candidates and has, by and large, succeeded.</p>

<p>In Ohio, one of the crypto industry&#39;s biggest foes in Congress - Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown was ousted, while pro-crypto candidates from both the Democratic and Republican parties won in Michigan, West Virgina, Indiana, Alabama and North Carolina.</p>

<p>Trump also unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial in September, and although details about the business, opens new tab have been scarce, investors have taken his personal interest in the sector as a friendly signal.</p>

<p>Billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Eric Trump, one of the president-elect&#39;s sons and executive vice president of his private conglomerate, The Trump Organization, is a keynote speaker at a bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi next month, according to the event organisers.</p>

<p>Gains in cryptocurrencies have been broad. Ether rose above $3,200 for the first time in over three months on Monday and was last fetching $3,192. Dogecoin , an alternative cryptocurrency that began as a satirical critique of the 2013 crypto frenzy, was at a three-year high.</p>]]></description>

						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<p>The world&#39;s first wooden satellite, built by Japanese researchers, was launched into space on Tuesday, in an early test of using timber in lunar and Mars exploration.</p>

<p>LignoSat, developed by Kyoto University and homebuilder Sumitomo Forestry, will be flown to the International Space Station on a SpaceX mission, and later released into orbit about 400 km (250 miles) above the Earth.</p>

<p>Named after the Latin word for &quot;wood&quot;, the palm-sized LignoSat is tasked to demonstrate the cosmic potential of the renewable material as humans explore living in space.</p>

<p>&quot;With timber, a material we can produce by ourselves, we will be able to build houses, live and work in space forever,&quot; said Takao Doi, an astronaut who has flown on the Space Shuttle and studies human space activities at Kyoto University.</p>

<p>With a 50-year plan of planting trees and building timber houses on the moon and Mars, Doi&#39;s team decided to develop a NASA-certified wooden satellite to prove wood is a space-grade material.</p>

<p>&quot;Early 1900s airplanes were made of wood,&quot; said Kyoto University forest science professor Koji Murata. &quot;A wooden satellite should be feasible, too.&quot;</p>

<p>Wood is more durable in space than on Earth because there&#39;s no water or oxygen that would rot or inflame it, Murata added.</p>

<p>A wooden satellite also minimises the environmental impact at the end of its life, the researchers say.</p>

<p>Decommissioned satellites must re-enter the atmosphere to avoid becoming</p>

<p><strong>space debris</strong></p>

<p>. Conventional metal satellites create aluminium oxide particles during re-entry, but wooden ones would just burn up with less pollution, Doi said.</p>

<p>&quot;Metal satellites might be banned in the future,&quot; Doi said. &quot;If we can prove our first wooden satellite works, we want to pitch it to Elon Musk&#39;s SpaceX.&quot; INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION</p>

<p>The researchers found that honoki, a kind of magnolia tree native in Japan and traditionally used for sword sheaths, is most suited for spacecraft, after a 10-month experiment aboard the International Space Station.</p>

<p>LignoSat is made of honoki, using a traditional Japanese crafts technique without screws or glue.</p>

<p>Once deployed, LignoSat will stay in the orbit for six months, with the electronic components onboard measuring how wood endures the extreme environment of space, where temperatures fluctuate from -100 to 100 degrees Celsius every 45 minutes as it orbits from darkness to sunlight.</p>

<p>LignoSat will also gauge wood&#39;s ability to reduce the impact of space radiation on semiconductors, making it useful for applications such as data centre construction, said Kenji Kariya, a manager at Sumitomo Forestry Tsukuba Research Institute.</p>

<p>&quot;It may seem outdated, but wood is actually cutting-edge technology as civilisation heads to the moon and Mars,&quot; he said. &quot;Expansion to space could invigorate the timber industry.&quot;</p>

						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<h3>Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have made significant strides in enhancing spacecraft efficiency for lunar missions through a cutting-edge propulsion approach known as multimode propulsion. This innovative method combines both chemical high-thrust and electric low-thrust propulsion using the same propellant, aiming to optimize spacecraft operations on missions to the Moon. Funded by NASA, the team examined four real mission scenarios to demonstrate the practical applications of this technology.</h3>

<p>Aerospace engineering Ph.D. student Bryan Cline emphasized the project&#39;s groundbreaking nature: &ldquo;This is the first high-fidelity analysis of multimode mission design for lunar missions relevant to NASA, particularly utilizing CubeSats.&rdquo; By employing a standard 12-unit CubeSat, the team was able to explore various mission profiles effectively.</p>

<p>One of the primary benefits of multimode propulsion lies in its ability to significantly reduce the spacecraft&#39;s dry mass. Cline explained that utilizing a single fuel tank streamlines mass and volume, which is a distinct advantage over traditional hybrid systems that require multiple propellants. &ldquo;With multimode systems, the flexibility to switch between high-thrust and low-thrust modes allows for better maneuverability and reduced fuel consumption,&rdquo; he noted.</p>

<p>Cline&#39;s team manually determined when to employ high-thrust or low-thrust during their mission simulations, which resulted in suboptimal trajectories. To enhance this process, he developed an algorithm that automatically identifies the optimal moments to switch thrust modes, ensuring the most efficient flight path. &ldquo;We created the first indirect optimal control technique tailored for multimode mission design, enabling us to achieve specific objectives such as minimizing fuel use and transfer time,&rdquo; Cline stated.</p>

<p>The researchers successfully tested this method on both two-dimensional transfers between Earth and Mars and three-dimensional transfers to geostationary orbit. Cline highlighted the versatility of the approach: &ldquo;The method is adaptable to a wide range of mission design challenges, ensuring optimal solutions through variational calculus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cline remarked on the potential of multimode propulsion as an emerging technology that enhances mission capabilities. &ldquo;This advancement provides greater flexibility and adaptability, allowing for missions that were previously unattainable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are at an exciting juncture for multimode propulsion, working to translate our laboratory research into practical applications that will benefit the broader space community.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>
