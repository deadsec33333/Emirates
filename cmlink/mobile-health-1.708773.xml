						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<p>The UAE Government has issued a Federal Decree-Law to regulate medical products, the pharmacy profession, and pharmaceutical establishments.</p>

<p>The objectives include solidifying the UAE&rsquo;s position as a globally trusted hub for pharmaceutical and medical industries, enhancing pharmaceutical security, and streamlining the development, approval, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of medical products, all in adherence to international standards and competitive costs and timelines.</p>

<p>The provisions of the Decree-Law apply to all medical products, including drug products, medical devices, pharmaceutical products, healthcare products, biological products, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and genetically modified organism products intended for medical use. It also covers chemical precursors, controlled substances, semi-controlled substances, and hazardous or toxic materials for human and veterinary use.</p>

<p>The Decree-Law governs all pharmaceutical establishments and biobanks within the UAE, including those located in free zones. It applies to pharmacies, pharmacy chains, compounding pharmacies, medical warehouses, medical storage facilities, manufacturing facilities, contract-based manufacturing companies, marketing firms, pharmaceutical consulting firms, pharmaceutical laboratories, pre-clinical and clinical research entities, bioequivalence centres, biobanks, contract-based research and development companies, and other pharmaceutical establishments specified by the UAE Cabinet.</p>

<p>Additionally, the law encompasses practitioners of the pharmacy profession operating across the UAE, including within free zones.</p>

<p>The Decree-Law regulates all aspects of licencing, monitoring, and supervising pharmaceutical establishments and biobanks. It includes provisions for ownership transfers, temporary suspensions, precautionary closures, and licence revocations. The legislation outlines the roles and responsibilities of the Emirates Drug Establishment, the Ministry of Health and Prevention, and local health authorities.</p>

<p>Under the law, manufacturing facilities, contract-based manufacturing companies, medical warehouses, medical storage facilities, marketing firms, pharmaceutical consulting firms, and pharmaceutical laboratories are subject to licencing and monitoring by the Emirates Drug Establishment.</p>

<p>Biobanks, pre-clinical and clinical research entities, contract-based research and development companies, and bioequivalence centres fall under the jurisdiction of either the Emirates Drug Establishment or the relevant local health authorities, each within its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Pharmacies, pharmacy chains, compounding pharmacies, blood storage units in hospitals, and medical stores in government health facilities with activities limited to storage are regulated by the ministry or the relevant local health authorities, each within its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Decree-Law prioritises fostering investment in the pharmaceutical sector by introducing an incentive framework to attract investments and encourage innovation and development within the medical industries. The Cabinet will issue a decision to establish this framework based on a proposal by the Chairman of the Emirates Drug Establishment in consultation with relevant health authorities and other stakeholders.</p>

<p>The Decree-Law also includes provisions to protect innovation by implementing a regulated protection mechanism for documents and data related to innovative medical products or those containing at least one new active ingredient, whether developed domestically or imported.</p>

<p>For the first time, the Emirates Drug Establishment is authorised to develop, publish, and update the UAE Pharmacopeia, approve reference pharmacopeias, and issue guidelines and standards for good practices aligned with internationally recognised principles.</p>

<p>The Decree-Law establishes clear conditions for granting marketing authorisations for medical products, including exclusive marketing authorisations, conditional marketing authorisations, and emergency use authorisations.</p>

<p>It introduces a fast-track approval pathway for innovative medical products of therapeutic importance and other qualifying medical products, ensuring compliance with international standards of quality, safety, and efficacy.</p>

<p>The legislation regulates all aspects of managing medical products, encompassing development, manufacturing, registration, pricing, import, export, circulation, distribution, possession, marketing, sale, use and safe disposal.</p>

<p>It includes general provisions for developing and manufacturing medical products in compliance with good practice guidelines issued by the Emirates Drug Establishment and aligned with international standards. For the first time, the law permits the transfer of excipients and solvents between licenced manufacturing facilities within the UAE, subject to approval by the Emirates Drug Establishment.</p>

<p>The Decree-Law also regulates the advertising, promotion, import, export, and re-export of medical products under the supervision of the Emirates Drug Establishment.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Decree-Law defines the provisions regulating the pricing of medical products and establishes the &ldquo;Pharmaceutical Policies Committee&rdquo;, working under the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Emirates Drug Establishment. The new law also requires pharmacy practitioners in the UAE to obtain a licence from the Ministry of Health and Prevention or the competent local health authority and specifies the duties of pharmacists and the activities that a clinical pharmacist is authorised to practice.</p>

<p>The Decree-Law regulates the provisions tied to the pharmacovigilance system in the UAE, ensuring the safe use of medical products and reducing side effects and adverse reactions. Additionally, it regulates, for the first time, the provisions for establishing and managing national databases for medical products, pharmaceutical facilities, and biobanks in the UAE.</p>

<p>The Decree-Law prescribes disciplinary measures for violations, including written warnings and financial fines ranging from AED1,000 to AED1 million for pharmaceutical establishments and biobanks and up to AED500,000 for practitioners of the pharmacy profession.</p>

<p>Penalties may also include temporary suspension of licences for up to six months or license revocation for severe breaches.</p>

<p>Entities and individuals covered under the law are granted a one-year grace period to comply with its provisions, with the possibility of an extension through a Cabinet decision.</p>]]></description>

<p>This protocol represents a significant and distinctive addition to the aviation sector in the UAE by enhancing national capabilities in air accident investigations and fostering collaboration among various relevant entities.</p>

<p>It marks a critical development in investigation methodologies by enabling investigators to consult experts in forensic medicine and aviation medicine to analyse the health status of flight crew members as one of the investigative aspects.

Together, these analyses integrate to yield the most precise conclusions regarding the causes of accidents and the contributing factors.</p>

<p>Abdullah bin Touq Al Marri stated, &ldquo;The adoption of this protocol, designed to provide more enablers for fostering a safer and more sustainable aviation environment, reflects our commitment to the wise leadership&#39;s directives to enhance aviation safety and develop innovative tools to improve air accident investigations and prevent their recurrence.</p>

<p>We take pride in the advanced status of the UAE in aviation security and safety, as well as its swift and sophisticated capabilities in dealing with air incidents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saif Mohammed Al Suwaidi, Director-General of the GCAA, explained that the protocol, with its policies and procedures developed in coordination and collaboration with the relevant entities in the country, represents a qualitative leap in the field of air accident investigations. It establishes a culture of multidisciplinary cooperation and strengthens joint national efforts to ensure the application of the best global standards in the aviation sector, identifying the causes of air accidents and preventing their recurrence.</p>

<p>Captain Aysha Mohammed Al Hamil, Assistant Director-General in Air Accident Investigations, stated, &ldquo;This protocol is a valuable technical development that enhances the effectiveness of investigations by incorporating advanced forensic methods. By utilising the expertise available in the UAE, we aim to build a more accurate and efficient investigations framework that helps identify accident causes and prevent their recurrence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The protocol emphasises the importance of collaboration between public and private sector entities, contributing to the long-term safety and sustainability of aviation, while reinforcing the UAE&#39;s position in the global aviation community.</p>]]></description>

						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>T<strong>he center in Dubai Investment Park-2 is the Group&rsquo;s second facility, after the launch of the LLH Medical Center in Al Quoz.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>LLH Hospital, part of Burjeel Holdings&mdash;a leading super-specialty healthcare provider in the MENA region&mdash;has launched a new medical center in Dubai Investment Park-2 to cater to the healthcare needs of the industrial workforce. This facility, following the successful launch of the LLH Medical Center in Al Quoz, further strengthens the Group&rsquo;s commitment to providing high-quality, accessible healthcare to the industrial workforce across key locations in Dubai.</p>

<p>Located in Mango Mall, Dubai Investment Park-2, the center, which caters to the significant population of industrial workers residing in the area, was inaugurated by Mr. Abdullah Lashkari, General Coordinator, Permanent Committee for Labour Affairs, Dubai. Equipped with specialty clinics, radiology services, laboratory services, physical rehabilitation, and a pharmacy, the medical center functions as a primary healthcare hub, offering a comprehensive range of services in one location. The center&rsquo;s board-certified doctors ensure every patient receives timely, high-quality care.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a significant milestone in our efforts to enhance the quality of life for workers in Dubai. This center is part of our commitment to providing integrated and comprehensive medical services, ensuring that workers receive the healthcare they deserve in an easy and convenient manner. At the Permanent Committee for Labour Affairs, we strive to promote a healthy and safe work environment, and we will continue our efforts to support initiatives that contribute to the workers&rsquo; well-being. We would like to thank Burjeel Holdings for this remarkable initiative, a valuable addition to the healthcare system in the Emirate,&rdquo; said Mr. Abdullah Lashkari.</p>

<p>In 2023, LLH opened its medical center in Al Quoz to provide accessible, high-quality care. The two strategically located centers are designed to serve the unique needs of the industrial workforce by offering a wide range of healthcare services. Together, they boost Burjeel Holdings&rsquo; capacity to deliver comprehensive care, ensuring that thousands of workers have access to essential medical services.</p>

<p>These centers enhance Burjeel Holdings&rsquo; established hub-and-spoke network, facilitating seamless care delivery. Complex cases or those needing specialized care are referred to Burjeel&rsquo;s secondary and tertiary facilities to ensure that all patients receive comprehensive medical services. Both centers also engage their communities through telehealth services, wellness campaigns, and preventive health programs, further emphasizing the Group&rsquo;s holistic approach to healthcare delivery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to make quality healthcare more accessible, particularly in communities that need it the most. By bringing healthcare services closer to the people, we ensure they can access essential care conveniently, whether near their homes or workplaces,&rdquo; said Mr. Bruno Dsouza, COO &ndash; Dubai &amp; Northern Emirates at Burjeel Holdings.</p>

<p>The medical centers significantly enhance LLH&rsquo;s existing network, which supports industrial health and caters to individuals from diverse socio-economic backgrounds. Established in 2007, LLH Hospital has been providing cost-effective, specialized, and quality healthcare services, meeting the needs of the growing population in Abu Dhabi through over 15 medical centers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Being closer to our patients allows us to better understand their needs and provide tailored care. From primary care to advanced diagnostics and rehabilitation, our facility is designed to support patients throughout their healthcare journey, with a strong emphasis on prevention and wellness,&rdquo; said Dr. Mitali Dhawal Modi, Medical Director, LLH Medical Center in Dubai Investment Park-2.</p>

<p>This expansion underscores Burjeel Holdings&rsquo; dedication to inclusivity and equity in healthcare, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of socio-economic background, receive the care they deserve.</p>

<div><strong>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>The collaboration will provide Maldivian patients access to specialized medical care, including multi-organ transplants, oncology, and endometriosis treatments, at the Group&rsquo;s flagship facility Burjeel Medical City</strong></div>

<div><strong>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>This partnership will significantly strengthen the healthcare ties between the UAE and the Maldives, attracting more international patients seeking world-class treatments.&nbsp;</strong></div>
</blockquote>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In a significant move to strengthen medical tourism ties and broaden healthcare options for Maldivians, Burjeel Holdings, a leading super-specialty healthcare provider in the MENA region, listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, has partnered with Aasandha Company Ltd, the administrator of the Maldives&rsquo; National Social Health Insurance Scheme. This strategic partnership opens the doors for Maldivian patients to access advanced medical treatments, including multi-organ transplants and complex medical care in key specialties including oncology, at Burjeel Medical City (BMC), the Group&rsquo;s flagship quaternary hospital in Abu Dhabi.&nbsp;</div>

<div>The collaboration agreement was signed at Aasandha Headquarters in Male by Mr. John Sunil, Group CEO of Burjeel Holdings, and Ms. Aminath Zeeniya, Managing Director/CEO of Aasandha, in the presence of senior officials from both organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>A Hub for Complex Care</strong></div>

<div>This collaboration provides the patients covered under the Maldives&rsquo; National Social Health Insurance Scheme with access to advanced care across specialties like cardiology and advanced orthopedics, and treatments for conditions like endometriosis at BMC, a growing hub for international patients in the region.

We are honored to provide Maldivian patients with access to advanced care, cutting-edge technology and renowned specialists at BMC.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Boosting Medical Tourism</strong></div>

<div>Abu Dhabi&rsquo;s strategic location as a gateway to Europe, Asia, and Africa positions it as a prime destination for international healthcare. With direct flights from Abu Dhabi to Male taking just over four hours, the Emirate offers Maldivians convenient access to advanced medical care. This collaboration not only enhances healthcare accessibility but also significantly boosts medical tourism between the UAE and the Maldives, attracting more international patients seeking world-class treatments.&nbsp;</div>

<div>This partnership streamlines the care journey for Maldivian patients through an efficient pre-authorization process and dedicated international patient coordinators. At BMC, patients benefit from a full spectrum of inpatient and outpatient services, state-of-the-art technology, internationally accredited standards, and a multidisciplinary approach to managing complex medical conditions. This comprehensive care model ensures Maldivians receive a seamless, high-quality healthcare experience in Abu Dhabi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>Ms. Aminath Zeeniya, Managing Director/CEO of Aasandha, said, &ldquo;We are delighted to collaborate with Burjeel Holdings to enhance the healthcare options available to Maldivians. This partnership ensures our citizens can access the best treatments in a world-class facility, strengthening the Maldives&rsquo; National Social Health Insurance Scheme.&rdquo;</div>

						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<p>With the pressures of daily life and the challenge of balancing work with health, many find it difficult to engage in physical activities, negatively affecting their health and life expectancy. However, a recent study reported by CNN reveals that regular exercise can extend life expectancy by at least five years.</p>

<p>Dr. Lennert Veerman, a public health professor at Griffith University in Australia, remarked: &quot;I was surprised to discover that the loss of life expectancy in the United States due to low physical activity could rival the damage caused by smoking and high blood pressure.&quot;</p>

<p>Veerman&#39;s research builds on a 2019 study, which showed that the risk of premature death decreases as physical activity increases. The latest study analyzed data from participants over the age of 40, a stage where mortality rates related to inactivity are more stable.</p>

<p>Using a life table&mdash;a tool that predicts the likelihood of individuals reaching a certain age&mdash;the researchers found that increasing daily physical activity by 111 minutes could add up to 11 years to the life expectancy of those with the lowest activity levels.</p>

<p>Veerman emphasized the need for collective efforts to achieve this goal, such as reducing reliance on cars and implementing long-term planning: &quot;We must work together to realize this vision, especially since the current healthcare system cannot sustain the rising costs associated with physical inactivity.&quot;</p>]]></description>

						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<p>A new study published in <em>The Lancet</em> has revealed a startling increase in the global prevalence of diabetes, with more than 800 million adults affected worldwide&mdash;almost double previous estimates. The research, conducted by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration and the World Health Organization (WHO), also highlights a concerning gap in treatment, with over half of individuals aged 30 and above who have diabetes not receiving proper care.</p>

<p>According to the study, in 2022, approximately 828 million adults aged 18 and older were living with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Alarmingly, 445 million of those aged 30 and older, accounting for 59% of cases, were not receiving treatment. This trend paints a grim picture of a rising global health issue that remains largely underaddressed.</p>

<p>The WHO had previously estimated that around 422 million people were affected by diabetes, a chronic condition that can lead to severe health complications if left untreated. The disease, which involves elevated blood sugar levels, can damage vital organs such as the heart, blood vessels, and nerves, leading to life-threatening complications.</p>

<p>The study&rsquo;s findings point to a significant rise in the global diabetes rate, which has doubled since 1990, now affecting 14% of the global adult population compared to just 7% in 1990. The increase is especially pronounced in low- and middle-income countries, where rising cases have not been matched with an increase in treatment access. In contrast, treatment rates in higher-income countries have improved, contributing to a growing disparity in care.</p>

<p>In some regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, access to treatment remains severely limited. Professor Jean Claude Mbanya from the University of Yaounde I in Cameroon pointed out that only 5-10% of individuals with diabetes in the region are receiving the necessary treatment. He emphasized that the lack of access to insulin or other essential medications&mdash;often due to high costs&mdash;leaves millions at risk of serious health complications.</p>

<p>This global study, the first of its kind to include treatment data from all countries, is based on over 1,000 studies involving more than 140 million people. To ensure accurate estimates, the study utilized both fasting plasma glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin tests, common diagnostic criteria for diabetes. This comprehensive approach was particularly important in regions like South Asia, where relying solely on fasting plasma glucose measurements may have missed numerous undiagnosed cases.</p>

<p>While the study could not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, it is widely believed that type 2 diabetes, which is often linked to obesity and poor diet, accounts for the majority of adult cases.</p>

<p>With diabetes rates soaring globally and treatment gaps widening, the need for urgent action to improve access to care and prevent further health complications has never been more critical. This comprehensive study highlights the gravity of the situation and calls for intensified global efforts to tackle the diabetes crisis.</p>]]></description>

<p>During its meeting, the board discussed Dubai Health&#39;s key achievements in the first term and reviewed several upcoming strategic projects and programmes aimed at enhancing care. The Board also reviewed progress on the Hamdan Bin Rashid Cancer Hospital.</p>

<p>New Diabetes Centre<br />
Scheduled to open in 2026, Dubai Health&rsquo;s new Diabetes Centre embodies the integrated academic health system&rsquo;s commitment to delivering care that evolves alongside continuous research and learning, in accordance with the highest international standards. The new centre builds on the continuous service provided through the existing Diabetes Centre, which celebrated 15 years of providing healthcare services to patients this year. Dubai Health&#39;s Diabetes Centre has been a cornerstone of specialised diabetes care, having served over 15,000 patients since its establishment in 2009.</p>

<p>The new centre will cover more than 53,000 square feet, double the size of the current facility, and will enable Dubai Health to treat twice as many patients in the next 10 years. The centre will also offer a broad range of services and advanced therapeutic programmes, enhancing the comprehensive healthcare experience. The new location is also easily accessible from various areas of Dubai.</p>

<p>Her Excellency Dr. Raja Easa Al Gurg, Member of the Dubai Health Board of Directors and Chair of the Steering Committee of the new Diabetes Centre, said: &quot;The new facility with its patient centred design will strengthen the integrated healthcare ecosystem in Dubai. Through a sharp focus on medical innovation and the adoption of the latest technologies, we aim to continuously develop services that provide the highest levels of specialised care for diabetes patients.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Supporting patients<br />
Dr. Mohamed Farooqi, Director of the Diabetes Centre and Consultant Endocrinologist at Dubai Health, emphasised the importance of the new centre and its role in supporting diabetes patients, stating: &quot;The new centre builds on Dubai Health&#39;s years of experience and commitment to exceptional care, offering both specialised treatment and prevention service to meet the needs for comprehensive care of patients across Dubai. With the addition of specialties such as cardiology, nephrology, and ophthalmology, we will be able to offer an advanced level of care.&quot;</p>

<p>He further remarked: &quot;The new centre demonstrates our dedication to incorporating the latest technologies into our academic health system, with an emphasis on integrating endocrinology specialties within paediatric care. We aim to deliver comprehensive treatment that meets patients&#39; needs and helps to enhance their long-term health outcomes.&quot;</p>

<p>Dubai Health&#39;s new diabetes centre aims to harness the promise of artificial intelligence alongside traditional methods of healthcare delivery. The facility will be equipped with advanced medical technology, and examination rooms will feature technologies designed to provide patients with a smooth and efficient experience.</p>]]></description>

						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<p>The Dubai Health Authority&rsquo;s (DHA) NABIDH initiative has reached a significant milestone, unifying over 9.47 million patient records and connecting more than 1,300 healthcare facilities.</p>

<p>With 81% of Dubai&rsquo;s healthcare professionals actively connected to the system, NABIDH is transforming patient data management and enhancing healthcare delivery across the Emirate.</p>

<p>DHA in collaboration with Kyndryl, co-hosted a workshop to encourage the private sector to adopt this pioneering technology. The workshop discussed key topics including enhancing patient outcomes through modern technology, AI in healthcare and the importance of single digital medical record for every patient. The workshop was attended by His Excellency Awadh Seghayer Al Ketbi, Director-General of the Dubai Health Authority and senior health officials from the government and private sector.</p>

<p>NABIDH, which stands for Network &amp; Analysis Backbone for Integrated Dubai Health, is integral to DHA&rsquo;s strategy to digitise healthcare services, ensuring each patient has a single, comprehensive electronic medical file accessible across all healthcare providers. This initiative is aimed at improving efficiency, minimising errors, and providing a more personalised patient care experience.</p>

<p>During a specialised workshop organised recently by DHA to discuss progress on the &quot;Nabidh&quot; platform, Awadh Seghayer Al Ketbi, Director General of DHA, emphasised that the Authority draws inspiration for its continuous digital transformations from the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai. His Highness&#39; directives aim to make Dubai the smartest city in the world. Al Ketbi also highlighted the role of His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the UAE and Chairman of The Executive Council of Dubai, whose guidance supports Dubai&rsquo;s international position and advancement.</p>

<p>Al Ketbi added that DHA has a portfolio of innovative projects and initiatives that serve the goals of digital and smart transformation in the Emirate of Dubai, including the rapidly advancing &quot;Nabidh&quot; platform. The platform&rsquo;s objectives include enhancing healthcare standards, ensuring effective communication between healthcare facilities, fostering better relationships between medical professionals and patients, and supporting decision-making processes. It also aims to integrate modern systems for disease prevention into the community.<br />
The workshop aimed to encourage the private sector to adopt this pioneering technology, while DHA provided an overview of the current progress of &quot;Nabidh.&quot; The discussions included improving patient outcomes through modern technology, the role of artificial intelligence in healthcare, and the importance of a unified digital medical record for each patient.</p>

<p>Mona Bajman CEO of Shared Support Services Sector at Dubai Health Authority stated that DHA spares no effort in acquiring the latest global smart solutions to support its development projects and programmes that align with Dubai&#39;s goals for health sustainability and well-being. She also stressed that DHA is committed to strengthening the efforts of Dubai&#39;s healthcare sector, helping it provide world-class services through a series of initiatives, including the &quot;Nabidh&quot; platform.</p>

<p>Bajman further added that the platform has successfully created a secure environment for exchanging reliable health data between healthcare facilities. It enables healthcare providers to share and securely access patients&#39; unified medical records from both public and private healthcare facilities across Dubai, maintaining the highest standards of privacy, accuracy, and speed.</p>

<p>Dr Mohammad Al Redha, Director of DHA&rsquo;s Health Informatics and Smart Health Department, elaborated, &ldquo;NABIDH&rsquo;s expansion to connect over 1,300 facilities and manage 9.47 million records is a notable achievement for Dubai&rsquo;s digital health ecosystem. This initiative provides a unified electronic medical record system that offers a comprehensive view of patients&rsquo; medical histories. It is integrated with the UAE&rsquo;s Riayati initiative, aiming for a single medical file for every individual in the country. We are pleased to see that 81% of Dubai&rsquo;s healthcare professionals are actively connected to the NABIDH system, and we are committed to ensuring that every healthcare provider benefits from this comprehensive platform.&rdquo;<br />
Kyndryl is a key managed infrastructure partner for the Dubai Health Authority. In this role, it supports the NABIDH initiative by managing the infrastructure that powers this system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are honoured to collaborate with DHA in transforming healthcare delivery through NABIDH. At Kyndryl, we are committed to leveraging our expertise in IT infrastructure to support innovative solutions that enhance citizen experiences and wellbeing,&rdquo; said Pieter Bil, Senior Vice President and Managing Director, Kyndryl Middle East and Africa. &ldquo;By ensuring NABIDH&rsquo;s secure and uninterrupted service, we are helping to create a more connected and efficient healthcare ecosystem, demonstrating our shared vision of a sustainable and advanced healthcare system for all.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<p>Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation for Medical and Educational Sciences successfully concluded a specialised scientific webinar yesterday, focusing on the latest updates in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>The event drew participation from prominent global experts and attracted a wide audience of healthcare professionals, researchers, and individuals engaged in oncology.</p>

<p>Achieving an accurate diagnosis requires the use of advanced techniques such as molecular profiling and genetic testing, which allow for the customisation of treatment plans based on each patient&rsquo;s unique characteristics. This complexity places significant demands on physicians to select and apply the most effective treatment paths, as discussed by the experts during the session.</p>

<p>In her remarks, Dr. Salama Al Muhairi, Director of Medical Excellence at Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation, underscored the foundation&#39;s commitment to continuous medical education and the importance of raising awareness about cutting-edge advancements in the fight against complex diseases like cancer.</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;At Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation for Medical and Educational Sciences, we are committed to fostering sustainable healthcare solutions by creating opportunities for positive cultural shifts in the medical community&#39;s approach to challenging diseases. We aim to provide an interactive platform for healthcare professionals to exchange expertise and knowledge, helping to elevate the quality of care provided to patients.</p>

<p>Our mission goes beyond the dissemination of new information or research; it&rsquo;s about cultivating a collaborative environment where professionals can stay up-to-date on the latest in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment while sharing their real-world experiences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Al Muhairi added, &ldquo;The complexity of breast cancer diagnosis, which can vary significantly depending on the genetic and biological factors of each patient, requires that physicians remain constantly trained and informed about the latest tools and techniques.

<p>Today&rsquo;s healthcare professionals need to master core technologies like MRI and advanced CT scans, along with the ability to interpret intricate genetic analyses, to determine the best treatment options for each patient. This ongoing education and interdisciplinary collaboration are vital to achieving optimal outcomes, and that&rsquo;s why events like this webinar are invaluable. They provide a unique opportunity to learn from global experts and exchange ideas on how to improve patient care and implement the latest research in clinical practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the webinar, the speakers stressed the importance of advanced imaging techniques, such as MRI and CT scans, alongside genetic profiling, in determining the exact stage of the disease and identifying the tumor type.</p>

<p>Despite these advancements, the experts pointed out that these technologies are not yet fully integrated into clinical practice worldwide, contributing to a gap between research and its real-world application.</p>

<p>The webinar featured distinguished contributions from Prof. Melinda Telli, Director of the Breast Cancer Programme at Stanford Cancer Institute, who presented the latest advancements in targeted therapies for triple-negative and hereditary breast cancer. Dr. Abeer Al Sayegh, Head of the Genomics Department at Sultan Qaboos Comprehensive Cancer Center, discussed the role of genomics in improving patient care through personalised treatment solutions.</p>

<p>Prof. Mehran Habibi, Associate Professor of Surgery at Northwell Health, provided valuable insights into surgical innovations, including oncoplastic breast surgery and wire-free tumor excision techniques.</p>

<p>The session was expertly moderated by Dr. Mouza Al Ameri, Assistant Professor of Surgery at UAE University and Tawam Hospital, whose extensive experience in breast cancer care enriched the discussions on best practices in treatment and research.</p>

<p>The webinar concluded with key recommendations aimed at strengthening collaboration among healthcare professionals and implementing the latest research findings in clinical settings. These efforts are expected to contribute to improving patient care in the region and advancing tangible progress in the fight against breast cancer.</p>]]></description>

It contributes to our nation&rsquo;s economic diversification, creates valuable socio-economic returns, and reaffirms Mubadala&rsquo;s ambitions within the sector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added, &ldquo;Being a responsible investor we continue to nurture future-centric solutions that boost our nation&rsquo;s GDP, increase job creation, foster innovation, and strengthen medical security, shaping the future of our communities with lasting impact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hocine Sidi Said, CEO of KELIX bio, said, &ldquo;The acquisition of GHH assets considerably strengthens our presence in the UAE and provides us access to a greater pipeline of products and technologies. Bringing these businesses and their colleagues into the KELIX bio network is exciting as it accelerates our path to becoming a global life science leader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Low Ping, Group CEO Yas Holding, commented, &ldquo;Divesting these subsidiaries to KELIX bio marks a strategic pivot for Yas Holding. This decision aligns with our commitment to enhancing healthcare access and innovation across the region. We are confident that under KELIX bio&#39;s stewardship, Wellpharma, Gulf Inject, Bioventure Healthcare, and Bioventure will continue to thrive and contribute significantly to the healthcare landscape. We look forward to witnessing their continued growth and the positive impact they will have on the life science sector at large.&quot;</p>

<p>The acquisition of four GHH assets by KELIX Bio significantly enhances the UAE&#39;s local life sciences capabilities through strategic investments.<br />
This move aligns with government initiatives such as &lsquo;Operation 300bn&rsquo; and &lsquo;Make it in the Emirates&rsquo;, which aim to strengthen the country&#39;s manufacturing sector.</p>

<p>These acquisitions advance Mubadala&#39;s efforts to establish a national pharma champion based in Abu Dhabi. They enhance the UAE&#39;s pharmaceutical infrastructure, address prevalent diseases, secure drug supply, reduce healthcare costs, and progress the nation toward a knowledge-based economy.</p>

<p>GlobalOne Healthcare Holding LLC (GHH) serves as the dedicated Healthcare Division of Yas Holding LLC, focusing on enhancing healthcare outcomes by investing in biopharmaceuticals and healthcare services.</p>]]></description>

	<li><strong><em>During World Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the Group&rsquo;s mammogram truck will visit various locations, offering massive screenings for women under the &lsquo;Scan for Life&rsquo; initiative.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of its commitment to promoting early detection and raising awareness about breast cancer, Burjeel Holdings is launching an initiative under the theme &lsquo;Scan for Life.&rsquo; During October, when World Breast Cancer Awareness Month is observed, the campaign aims to emphasize the critical importance of regular breast cancer screenings. Burjeel&rsquo;s signature Pink Truck will visit multiple locations throughout the month to offer convenient screenings for women.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;Scan for Life&rsquo; campaign emphasizes that a single scan can provide life-saving information, ensuring early detection through Burjeel&rsquo;s advanced breast cancer screenings. It seeks to make breast cancer screenings more accessible, reaching women across various sectors, particularly those over 40 and in the high-risk category. The campaign encourages women to prioritize their health and take advantage of these complimentary mammograms, underscoring the life-saving potential of early detection.</p>

<p>During this month, the Burjeel Pink Truck will visit key locations, including Mohamed Bin Zayed University for Humanities, Abu Dhabi Police GHQ, Ministry of Justice, Zayed International Airport, and the General Pension and Social Security Authority (GPSSA), among others. This outreach will empower women across various sectors to prioritize their health by undergoing mammograms and learning about breast cancer prevention. The mobile unit will also travel to malls, business centers, and educational institutions such as Marina Mall, Rosewood Abu Dhabi, Al Dar Group, Yasmina British Academy Campus, and Dunes International School.</p>

<p>At each location, clinicians will offer complimentary mammograms and educate women about the importance of regular self-examinations and screenings, providing vital information on breast cancer symptoms and risk factors.</p>

<p>Prof. Humaid Al Shamsi, CEO of Burjeel Cancer Institute, emphasized the importance of this campaign, stating, &ldquo;Breast cancer remains one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment. By bringing screenings directly to workplaces, government entities, and public spaces, we are removing barriers and making it easier for women to prioritize their health. Through &lsquo;Scan for Life,&rsquo; we hope to encourage more women to take the first step towards prevention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burjeel Holdings is also working closely with its partners across the UAE to host awareness sessions led by medical experts. These sessions will focus on educating participants about the symptoms of breast cancer, available treatments, and lifestyle changes that can reduce risk.</p>

<p>For more information about the &lsquo;Scan for Life&rsquo; campaign and screening locations, call Burjeel Cancer Institute on 800 23.</p>
