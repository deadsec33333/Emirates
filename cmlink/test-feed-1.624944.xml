						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s always sweet and brave on part of the cabin crew to tell travellers on board that they will try and deal with any requests passengers may have.</p>

<p>Requests such as more food, more drinks, extra blanket and change of seat are manageable.</p>

<p>But how about opening the window for fresh air? Where&#39;s the onboard cash machine? Yes, cabin crew at 30,000 ft do get some of the weirdest of requests you can ever imagine.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve put together some of the silliest requests, courtesy of Quora, cabincrew.com and Virgin Atlantic.</p>

<p>As soon as the floor was open in Quora for &quot;What are the weirdest things flight attendants have seen in their line of duty&quot;, Flight attendant Olivia Roqua, jumped to it and was ready with a flurry of responses.</p>

<p>She talks about a passenger asking if it was possible to book a massage during the flight and multiple time while flying over the North Pole passengers demanding to know why wifi wasn&#39;t working.</p>

<p>She couldn&#39;t help but recall passengers complaining about turbulence and demanding air attendants to stop it.</p>

<p>Ms Roqua seemed very cross and says, &quot;People lose their sense of reality when they step through the door of an aircraft.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve had people wanting to know what altitude we are at before we have taken off.&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen Janet Jackson eating only caviar and stipulating no-one should pass on her side of the aircraft. And then there is Demi Moore requesting a pineapple to be carved on board.</p>

<p>And this is not all. Here are few more strange requests by passengers:</p>

<p>&bull; Flying into Nice, south of France, one cheeky passenger asked a stewardess if the pilot could &quot;go a bit further down the coast so we can have a look at Monaco&quot;.</p>

<p>&bull; Where&#39;s the onboard cash machine?</p>

<p>&bull; Why can&rsquo;t you open the window and give us some air? It&rsquo;s really stuffy in here.</p>

<p>&bull; If the captain&rsquo;s in the loo, who&rsquo;s driving this thing?</p>

<p>&bull; My children are getting bored and fidgety. Is there anyone in the cabin crew that can do magic tricks?</p>

<p>&bull; A gentleman complained of a headache on a Milan flight and asked what the dull whirring sound was. When told it was the jet engine he replied: &quot;Tell the captain to turn them off because my head is really sore.&quot; He went on to threaten making an official complaint &#39;as the terms and conditions did not state how loud the engines were during the flight&#39;.</p>

<p>&bull; One customer coming into London was worried about Heathrow being so close to Windsor Castle. He asked if cabin crew could arrange for the planes not to fly over the castle in the future in case the Queen found it a nuisance.</p>

<p>&bull; One stewardess heard: &quot;Why am I getting such a poor mobile phone signal? This flight is going to be really long and I&rsquo;ll be bored if I can&rsquo;t use my smart phone.&quot;</p>

<p>&bull; An elderly gentleman flying from Australia was disappointed that the flight attendants weren&rsquo;t attractive enough. &quot;They were much prettier in the adverts, so the flight has not lived up to my expectations,&quot; he complained.</p>

<p>&bull; &quot;I was hoping to see the Grand Canyon but these clouds are in the way. Please can you ask the pilot to fly a bit lower?&quot;</p>]]></description>

						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Look up at the Sky&rdquo; day today, but in Dubai &ndash; residents and tourists &ndash; all do admire the clear skies - every day.</p>

<p>Yes, we have millions of tourists coming to the emirate to enjoy sun and sand here.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://media.emirates247.com/images/2016/04/articles112-462.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is definitely the sun that brings me here every year as I own a holiday home on the Palm. I just love to come here, spend time looking up at the blue clear sky. It is something that we all want to have back home as well,&rdquo; says Natalya (first name only) from Russia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is quite cold in Russia and hence a visit to Dubai is quite mandatory for all of us. We love the weather and the clear skies. But something we can&rsquo;t miss is the beautiful skyline of Dubai on a clear day,&rdquo; she adds.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://media.emirates247.com/images/2016/04/articles112-463.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 507px;" /></p>

<p>The origins of this Look up at the Sky spring event is unknown, but is celebrated on April 14 every year. The purpose is primarily to look up at the blue skies and admire it.</p>

<p>Of course, as Natalya, said, something you can&rsquo;t miss when looking at the sky is the amazing skyline here. It lists among the top 10 skylines in the world.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://media.emirates247.com/images/2016/04/articles112-464.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 420px;" /></p>

<p>Dubai is the only city from the Gulf Co-operation Council countries to make it to the list. The emirate is home the iconic Burj Khalifa (828 metres), the world&rsquo;s tallest tower; Princess Tower (414 metres), the world&rsquo;s highest residential tower, and JW Marriott Marquis (355 metres), the world&rsquo;s highest hotel.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.emporis.com/city/100485/dubai-united-arab-emirates" target="_blank">Emporis data</a> reveals Dubai has 2,281 buildings of which 1317 exist, 405 planned and 321 under construction. Overall, there are 1,229 high-rises and 518 skyscrapers.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://media.emirates247.com/images/2016/04/articles112-466.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 555px;" /></p>

<p>Dubai Marina &ndash; one community in the emirate, is host to world&rsquo;s four tallest towers. Opening this year is 425-metre Marina 101, the tallest tower in the Marina area.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://media.emirates247.com/images/2016/04/articles112-465.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 423px;" /></p>

<p>Just opposite the Marina, before Dubai hosts Expo 2020, Burj 2020 will be another landmark coming up. And in another part of the emirate, The Tower at Dubai Creek Harbour will set the sky glazing with lights as it will rise a notch higher than Burj Khalifa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The existing skyline and the new towers will make us look at the sky more often than we do. We will not just admire the weather, Sun but the excellent man-made structures that will make the Sky seem more beautiful,&rdquo; says Rohit Kumar from India.</p>]]></description>

						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<p>Three body parts &mdash; including a foot &mdash; found in a homeowner&#39;s recycling bin likely belong to a woman who was reported missing Saturday morning, Seattle police said Monday.</p>

<p>Seattle Police Chief Kathleen O&#39;Toole said at an evening news conference that an arrest had been made in the case and detectives believe the human remains are that of Ingrid Lyne, a 40-year-old mother of three who works as a nurse in Seattle.</p>

<p>&quot;All evidence leads in the direction of that missing woman,&quot; O&#39;Toole said.</p>

<p>Friends of Lyne said they last saw her Friday afternoon and that she had planned to go on a date to a Mariners baseball game Friday night with someone she met online.</p>

<p>The King County Medical Examiner&#39;s Office will make the final determination of identity.</p>

<p>Police arrested John Robert Charlton, 37, on Monday morning in Snohomish County, north of Seattle. He&#39;s been booked into jail on investigation of homicide. It wasn&#39;t immediately clear if Charlton had an attorney.</p>

<p>Police don&#39;t believe there are any other suspects, O&#39;Toole said.</p>

<p>A homeowner in Seattle called police at 4 p.m. Saturday after discovering the body parts. Police say the body parts had been packaged in plastic bags and placed in the bin sometime late Friday or on Saturday. The bin had been emptied of recyclables Friday.</p>

<p>Police previously described the remains as fresh. They said they had searched other bins in the area and found nothing of note.</p>

<p>Police are still searching for Lyne&#39;s vehicle, a grey 2015 Toyota Highlander with Washington license plates.</p>]]></description>

						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>The spattering of showers over the past 24 hours will make way for different intensities of rainfall across the UAE today and tomorrow, with affected areas to include Dubai, Abu Dhabi, the northern and western internal areas.</p>

<p>The UAE&rsquo;s National Centre for Meteorology and Seismology (NCMS) has issued an alert about the unstable weather conditions, warning of the occasional strong winds and &lsquo;very rough&rsquo; seas that could see wave height reach 10 feet.</p>

<p>In a weather alert issued on Thursday morning, the country&rsquo;s forecaster further said: &ldquo;Unstable weather ahead, with the cloud amount increasing over different areas associated with some towering clouds and different intensities of rainfall over scattered areas, especially during night and Friday morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The NCMS continued: &ldquo;Moderate to fresh winds in general, strong at times, will affect especially over the sea and exposed areas causing blowing dust and sand and low visibility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sea is rough to very rough with cloud activity over Arabian Gulf and Oman Sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The weather will continue in a similar pattern on Friday, with rain affecting internal areas of Abu Dhabi, including Liwa, along with Al Ain and the northern internal areas of the country.</p>

<p>A low-pressure system has been sweeping across the Gulf, bringing rain and the occasional thunderstorms to Saudi Arabia and Qatar.</p>

<p>Qatar Meteorology has also warned of thunderstorms over the country on Thursday, while flashflood warning have been issued for parts of Saudi, east of Riyadh.</p>

<p><strong>Earlier Story:</strong></p>

<p>After reports of rainfall in Ras Al Khaimah on Wednesday morning, more showers have been reported in Al Hamra and Dalma Island by late afternoon.</p>

<p>The UAE&rsquo;s weather forecaster has also issued a warning regarding gushing southeasterly winds, which have hindered horizontal visibility to less than 1,000 metres as sand and dust blows across open areas.</p>

<p>The areas particularly affected around 3pm include the western and internal areas of UAE, while a shroud of haze covers Dubai and Abu Dhabi city.</p>

<p><strong>Earlier Story:</strong></p>

<p>As the mercury reached 18.4 degrees Celsius on Jebel Jais in Ras Al Khaimah, the temperatures are finally cooling off and rain commenced in the district of Shaam around 9am, according to the country&rsquo;s Met office.</p>

<p>A low pressure system moving across the Gulf will bring rain and the occasional thunderstorm to the UAE over the next three days.</p>

<p>Scattered showers are expected to hit the western part of the country in the early hours of Wednesday, with winds picking up speed to raise dust and sand over open areas and reducing visibility.</p>

<p>The system will gain momentum in the late hours of the day, bringing rainfall to areas such as Liwa, Madinat Zayed and Al Ruwais, with the wet weather extending to Dubai, Sharjah and other parts of the Northern Emirates by Thursday.</p>

<p>A spokesperson with the UAE&#39;s National Centre for Meteorology and Seismology (NCMS) told Emirates 24|7 that the system affecting the UAE is an extension of the weather that is being experienced in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The UAE is under the effect of a surface low pressure system that is moving from southwest to the east, which is associated with different intensities of rainfall and gushing wind speeds,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the early hours of Wednesday, the southwest region of UAE and the islands will experience scattered showers with moderate to fresh winds, which could be gushing at times to reach strengths of speeds up to 70km per hour,&rdquo; the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>Areas that could also be affected include Al Ghuwaifat and Khalifa City.</p>

<p>The towerin&lrm;g clouds will increase over the UAE by Thursday, stretching the wet weather towards Al Ain and other coastal areas that include Dubai, Sharjah and the northern emirates.</p>

<p>By Friday, parts of Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah may also experience the occasional thunderstorm, even as rough seas will continue across three days with wave height reaching six to eight feet at intervals in the Arabian Gulf and the Oman Sea.</p>

<p>However, the good news is, the soaring temperatures that the UAE has been experiencing &ndash; reaching highs off 41 degrees Celsius on Tuesday &ndash; will finally plummet by Friday by eight degrees or so.</p>

<p>Over the past 24 hours the weather system has brought isolated showers to Qatar, while Saudi Arabia has been experiencing thunderstorms and drop in Mercury west of Riyadh, with flashflood warnings in place.</p>

<p><strong>EARLIER REPORT: Rainfall, rough seas and poor visibility alert</strong></p>

<p>The Meteorology Department of the National Centre for Meteorology and Seismology, NCMS, has issued a weather report for Tuesday to Friday, saying that on Tuesday and Wednesday the UAE will be affected by a surface low pressure extending over the south western areas of the Arab Peninsula associated with different amounts of clouds from the west and southwest.</p>

<p>The weather will be partly cloudy and hazy in general, with rise in temperatures by Tuesday over some areas. Cloud amounts will gradually increase over some areas of Abu Dhabi Emirate by afternoon and night, especially westward towards Al Ruwais, the western islands and some southern interiors, with a chance of scattered rain.</p>

<p>The winds will be moderate to fresh, 18 - 28 Km per hour, reaching 40 Kph over some areas, and causing blowing dust over exposed areas. The sea will be moderate in the Arabian Gulf, rough at times with cloud activity, and moderate in the Sea of Oman.</p>

<p>The low pressure is expected to deepen in the upper layers from Wednesday night to Friday.</p>

<p>As a result, huge cloud amounts will move from the southwest and west toward the state. The weather will become unstable. Cloud amounts will increase occasionally, and probably associated with some towering clouds and different intensities of scattered rain, starting from west of Abu Dhabi and including Al Ghuwaifat, Al Ruwais, Madinat Zayed, Liwa, and extending over Al Ain and different parts of the Northern Emirates, especially the coasts.</p>

<p>The winds will freshen at times, reaching 55 Kph with towering clouds, and causing blowing dust and sand with poor visibility at times over exposed areas, with an associated fall of temperatures. Sea will be rough at times in the Arabian Gulf and Oman Sea.</p>

<p>NCMS advices all to take care in case of poor visibility due to blowing dust, raised sand, and the rainfall. It also warns mariners to avoid going to sea during this period due to the rough waves, especially during cloud activity.</p>

						    				  	<description><![CDATA[<p>When a Thai Airways flight hit a patch of turbulence, five crew members and one passenger were left injured.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://media.emirates247.com/images/2016/04/articles112-467.jpg" style="width: 456px; height: 591px;" /></p>

<p><strong><em>(Facebook)</em></strong></p>

<p>The airline has issued a statement following the incident and apologized to the passengers while praising the pilots for landing the aircraft safely.</p>

<p>However, about 72 passengers and 12 crew members were left terrified when a flight from Jakarta to Bangkok when the jet was caught in turbulence above Singapore.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://media.emirates247.com/images/2016/04/articles112-468.jpg" style="height: 587px; width: 456px;" /></p>

<p><strong><em>(Facebook)</em></strong></p>

<p>The Boeing 777 plane resembled a &#39;war zone&#39; with passengers&#39; belongings strewn about and what appeared to be blood was splattered across one seat in the images shared on social media by Kru P&rsquo;Birth, a member of Thai Airways cabin crew.</p>

<p>The injured passenger is said to have banged his head on the roof of the plane after he was thrown into the air since he was not wearing his seatbelt, Thai news site Khaosod reported.</p>

<p>&quot;All those who were hurt on the aircraft have returned home from hospital,&quot; the airline&#39;s statement read.</p>]]></description>

<p>Tragically, both the babies died a few minutes after birth and the doctor proclaimed that the babies&#39; conditions were not compatible with life, reports <a href="http://zimbabwenewsday.co.uk/2016/04/masvingo-woman-gives-birth-headless-baby/" target="_blank">Zimbabwe News Day</a>.</p>

<p>Such cases are rare, say doctors. Such deformations occur in the mother&#39;s womb in the very early stages of pregnancy and are generally known as congenital abnormality.</p>
